# Stress-Predicting-Model
A supervised machine learning model that uses a decision tree to accurately predict stress level from humidity, temperature and step-count values for an individual.

The model predicts with an accuracy score of 99.7% and uses the following decision tree:

The repository features a python notebook that uses libraries like pandas and scikit learn for the model.

The dataset was obtained from : L. Rachakonda, S. P. Mohanty, E. Kougianos, and P. Sundaravadivel, “Stress-Lysis: A DNN-Integrated Edge Device for Stress Level Detection in the IoMT,” IEEE Trans. Conum. Electron., vol. 65, no. 4, pp. 474–483, 2019.
